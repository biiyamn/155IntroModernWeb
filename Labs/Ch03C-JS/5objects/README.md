# Chapter 3C: Create and call functions

## Steps

 
1. In your `/WIP/` directory create a `CSS` folder and a file `CSSpractice.html`. 

1. Type html and choose the template that is just labeled html.

1. Notice:
    * that the title tag is highlighted - type CSSPractice.
    * that there is a link to an external stylesheet main.css
    * that there is a script tag - remove it

1. Create the main.css file at the same level as your html file.
