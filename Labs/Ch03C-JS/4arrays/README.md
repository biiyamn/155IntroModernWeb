# Chapter 3C: Array practice

## Steps
 

1. Continue with your practice file.

1. Add a `<div id="hobbies"></div>` to your page

1. Create an onload event for the page that calls a function called init()

1. In init() function
    * hard-code a string array with some (3-5) favorite hobbies.
    * declare a variable output and set its value to what is returned form a new function called printHobbies, that you pass the array into

1. In the new function:
    * create a string variable to store output
    * Loop through the passed in array, updating the string to create a final string of the format:
    ```
    I like 4 things: x, and y, and z
    ```
    * return the new string

1. In init() set the innerHTML property of document.getElementById to your new output string

1. Create a new div with a new id.  Write a new function which creates an unordered list of items displayed in the new id.
